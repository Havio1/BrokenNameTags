# Broken Name Tags
Originally created by [bloofirephoenix](https://modrinth.com/user/bloofirephoenix); Forked by [Havio](https://modrinth.com/user/Havio)

# What's Included?
Broken name-tags drop when a pet or an entity with a custom name dies. 
These name-tags are meant to be a memento of your fallen friend. 

They include the name of the animal and the death message and cannot be used again.

## Additional Information

While this mod is largely serverside, the client must have it installed to see the death message
added to the name-tag's tooltip, to prevent the interaction animation from playing, and to see the custom texture.

There is a data pack tag called "blacklist", this is a tag to prevent entities from dropping
a broken name-tag upon their death.
- By default, this includes villagers, piglins, piglin brutes, boats, minecarts, and all illagers.

Of course, you are free to add or remove any entities.
